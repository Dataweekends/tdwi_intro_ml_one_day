https://www.anaconda.com/download

### Instructions for Conda environment creation

The following is not necessary if you have a recent version of Anaconda installed on your computer. If you want to create a virtual environment specifically for this tutorial, we provide an [environment configuration file](environment.yml). From the terminal follow these steps:

#### Change to course folder

```
cd tdwi_intro_ml_one_day
```

#### Create the course environment

```
conda env create
```

wait for the environment to create, this may take a few minutes

#### Activate the environment (Mac/Linux)
```
conda activate tdwi
```

#### Activate the environment (Windows)
```
activate tdwi
```

Check that your prompt changed to

```
(tdwi) $
```

Now you can run jupyter notebook from within the environment.



### Troubleshooting

#### Updating Conda

If you have installed Anaconda a long time ago, you may want to update it by running

```
conda update conda
```

and then

```
conda update anaconda
```
